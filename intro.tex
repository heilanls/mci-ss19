	\subsection{Utility, Usability, Likeability}
		\subsubsection*{Utility}
			a product can be used to reach a certain goal or to perform a certain task. This is	essential!
			
		\subsubsection*{Usabiltiy}
			relates to the question of quality and efficiency. E.g. how well does a product	support the user to reach a certain goal or to perform a certain task.
			
		\subsubsection*{Likeability}
			this may be related to utility and usability but not necessarily. People may like a
			product for any other reason\ldots
